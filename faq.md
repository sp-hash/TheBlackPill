# Frequently asked questions

(Sorted by most frequently asked)

## Does this unlocker have a fee? 

Yes. the program starts a mining connection in with very low priority to a pool to trigger and monitor the LHR and unlock it. If you run you standalone it will use 0-5% of the gpu. If you run it with another mining software, the other mining software will take over the gpu, 99.9% unlock? You can test it yourself. on Ethereum I get 100% unlock, but you might need to add a few watts. 

## Is this a virus?

The program is mining to a miningpool, and can therefore have false positives on antivirus software. Mostly on windows.
Make sure that you download the software from the correct url,

## Is a 120% unlock possible

This software was made to be run on miningsoftware that doesn't have a 100% LHR unlock feature implemented. Team Black Miner, Spminer, Phoenixminer, Claymores miner, ccminer, older versions of Gminer, t-rex, lolminer, nbminer. And it will never improve the performance more than 100% unlock.
